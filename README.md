Computel is designed for measuring mean telomere length from Illumina Whole Genome NGS Sequencing data.

### Operating Systems
Computel works with Windows and Unix operating systems, however in the v0.2 release, functionality of inputting compressed fastq files works only with Unix type systems. 

### Installation
For installation, download the src folder, and OS-specific binaries, and follow the instructions in the Computel User Manual. 

#### Binaries
Note, Computel works with only some versions of Bowtie, and with a modified version of Samtools. So if you'd like to use your own binaries, read the Computel User Manual carefully, before doing that!
